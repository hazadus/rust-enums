# Enums and Pattern Matching

This repo includes code samples for chapter 6 of the "Rust Book".

## Summary

Enums allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible variants. First we’ll define and use an `enum` to show how an `enum` can encode meaning along with data. Next, we’ll explore a particularly useful `enum`, called `Option`, which expresses that a value can be either something or nothing. Then we’ll look at how pattern matching in the `match` expression makes it easy to run different code for different values of an `enum`. Finally, we’ll cover how the if let construct is another convenient and concise idiom available to handle enums in your code.
